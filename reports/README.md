# Reports

This folder is reserved for generated evaluation and performance reports.

Generated report files are intentionally excluded from git to keep the repository clean.

## Generate reports locally

- `python evaluate.py`
- `python performance_test.py`

Outputs should be treated as runtime artifacts, not source-controlled documents.
