    "body": "Hi there,\n\nI got the ProStyle 5000 as a Christmas gift on December 25, 2025. The digital display stopped showing the temperature after just 2 weeks of use.\n\nThe dryer itself still works fine, but I can't see what temperature I'm using which defeats the purpose of the smart features.\n\nSerial number: PS5K-2025-43210\n\nI don't have the receipt since it was a gift, but my mom bought it from your official website.\n\nCan you look up the order with the serial number?\n\nAmanda Lee\n234 River Road\nPortland, OR 97201\n503-555-0188",
