    "body": "Hello HairTech,\n\nI purchased the EcoBreeze dryer on June 15, 2025 from Target. I love the eco-friendly design!\n\nUnfortunately, the bamboo handle has developed a crack along its length. I haven't dropped it or mishandled it - the crack just appeared.\n\nI'm concerned it might break completely. Serial: EB-2025-23456.\n\nI still have my receipt. Happy to recycle the defective unit.\n\nMarcus Brown\n567 Green Lane\nBoulder, CO 80301\n720-555-0134",
