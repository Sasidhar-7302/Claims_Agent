    "body": "Hello,\n\nI purchased a ProStyle 3000 hair dryer on November 20, 2025 from Amazon. The order number is 112-4567890-1234567.\n\nLast week, the dryer suddenly stopped working. When I turn it on, nothing happens - no heat, no fan, no lights. I've tried different outlets and it's definitely not a power issue.\n\nI've been very careful with the dryer and only use it at home for personal use about 3 times a week.\n\nThe serial number is PS3K-2025-78542.\n\nPlease let me know how to proceed with a warranty claim.\n\nThank you,\nSarah Johnson\n123 Oak Street\nAustin, TX 78701\nPhone: 512-555-0142",
