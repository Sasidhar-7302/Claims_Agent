    "body": "To whom it may concern,\n\nI purchased the QuickDry Express on November 28, 2025. Serial: QDE-2025-67432.\n\nThe dryer keeps shutting off after about 5 minutes of use. I believe the overheat protection is malfunctioning because it happens even when the vents are completely clear.\n\nI've followed all the maintenance guidelines - cleaning the filter after each use and allowing cool-down periods.\n\nReceipt from Walmart attached.\n\nRobert Taylor\n888 Elm Street\nPhoenix, AZ 85001\n602-555-0129",
