We use it for about 6 hours a day on clients.\n\nFor the past week, the motor has been making a grinding noise and the heat output seems reduced. It's affecting our ability to serve clients efficiently.\n\nSerial number: SE7K-2025-91234\nOrder confirmation from your website attached.\n\nBusiness info:\nMike's Cuts\n456 Main Street\nSan Francisco, CA 94102\nBusiness License: SF-2024-88901\n\nPlease help ASAP!\n\nMike Chen\n415-555-0198",
